DESCRIPTION:During this transit you tend to feel irritable and frustrated a
 s you want to break free of past restrictions. Rebellion can be a major pr
 oblem\, particularly if you feel that something or someone is standing in 
 your way. Patience is a virtue which seems so difficult to maintain during
  this transit\, and yet it is the trait which you need to develop.

DESCRIPTION:Tension arises as other people or events challenge your ideas. 
 You may find that others are particularly critical during this transit cau
 sing you to rethink your attitudes. Your confidence in making decisions is
  shaky and therefore it is not a good time to finalise any plans with long
 -term consequences. Disagreements with others may lead to a breakdown in c
 ommunications. By the end of this transit you should have a clearer idea o
 f your true opinions and beliefs with a realisation of what can be comprom
 ised and what cannot.

 omes naturally. This is a very healing time.

DESCRIPTION:Relations with other people\, either individuals or groups\, ca
 n be stressful during this transit. It is time to reassess your connection
 s with individuals and groups with a view to moving on with your life's pu
 rpose. Any individual or group standing in your path is liable to be pushe
 d out of the way\, as you seek new experiences. Of course it is not easy t
 o let go of links from the past\, particularly if one feels frightened of 
 new experiences without the safety of past alliances. If you can focus on 
 the future rather than the past\, you will discover that as one door shuts
  another opens.

DESCRIPTION:Everything seems a little larger than life right now. You feel 
 as if all of your dreams and wishes are coming true now. In some ways you 
 are correct. Life is full of many rewards right now. However\, you need to
  make choices rather than try to take on every opportunity that comes your
  way. If you are not careful you may well overindulge and overestimate you
 r own abilities. As a result your life may become imbalanced. You need to 
 make sure that you do not neglect one area of your life as you pursue your
  own goals. You need to balance your home\, family\, work and marriage\, w
 ith your own interests and appetites. The problem is that you are currentl
 y going through a somewhat egotistical stage. On the positive side you are
  eager to achieve your goals and are quite capable of doing so. Gifts\, re
 wards and awards may well come your way. You may also attract warm wishes 
 and gifts from friends\, lovers\, colleagues and family members. However\,
  if you are not careful you squander your opportunities by taking things o
 r people for granted. As a result you over-commit yourself\, neglect loved
  ones and run out of energy. A time of short-term excess can result in los
 s of all that is meaningful. If you can slow down and appreciate the gifts
  and those who give then you are most likely to gain some enduring benefit
 s. However\, if you remain self-righteous and continue to indulge your eve
 ry whim then you could fritter away this period of your life.

DESCRIPTION:There are a few transits in astrology which are linked with wha
 t society calls the "mid-life crisis". This is one of them and usually occ
 urs in your early 40s. During this transit you review your life's goals an
 d dreams. Like the character Scrooge in Charles Dickens' tale of The Chris
 tmas Carol you have the chance to reflect on your visions of the past\, pr
 esent and for the future. You see what has been achieved and what remainst
 o be done. In some cases you can feel disillusioned at how little you have
  achieved. The trouble is that you are vulnerable to feelings of failure r
 ight now. However\, on a more positive note\, by the end of this transit y
 ou can also gain much insight into which visions may have been sheer wishf
 ul thinking and which are achievable.

 surprised by a lack commitment in your personal relationships. You may be 
 wilful and see anyone else's claim on you as an obstacle to your freedom o
 f self-expression.  You need to beware of jeopardising the benefits of you
 r relationship. The key is to keep the good parts\, while examining and fi
 nd new solutions for the areas in which you are limited. You may also expe
 rience financial tensions during this time.

DESCRIPTION:This is an intensely emotional time\, possibly one of the most 
 emotional times of your life. Changes\, usually involving your family and 
 in particular mother or other women in the family\, invoke powerful emotio
 ns. You may suffer grief\, or enter into an intense emotional battle with 
 a loved one or authorities. Metaphysical and self-improvement courses will
  be deeply healing\, as will psychotherapy. It is best to use this time to
  delve deeply into your emotions and let go of old emotional habits and em
 brace your loved ones with a sense of honesty and integrity that comes fro
 m the depths of your being.

DESCRIPTION:This is an emotional time\, during which your feelings are not 
 as reliable as usual. The trouble is that you are likely to overreact righ
 t now. Close personal friends and relatives\, in particular women\, are st
 irring up your feelings. Perhaps you are hurt by their actions\, or perhap
 s they are reacting to you. Your life is changing and you feel insecure. T
 hese changes are likely to be occurring in your family and home life. You 
 may even move house during this period. On the other hand the changes may 
 be taking place within. However\, these changes are manifesting in your li
 fe\, your perceptions are unlikely to be correct right now. You would be w
 ell advised to think before you speak. It is far better to take some time 
 to carefully consider your words and actions until you are feeling more se
 cure. In the meantime you could enjoy reading moving stories\, going to th
 e cinema or spending time with young children and animals. Counseling may 
 also be beneficial\, if you feel that it would help you adapt to your chan
 ging relationships and environment.

 citing direction having cleared your path of unwanted debris.
