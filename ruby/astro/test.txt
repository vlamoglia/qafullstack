SOLAR FIRE DYNAMIC INTERPRETATIONS REPORT


TRANSITS: Transits to Natal Interpretations

These interpretations have been written to apply to transits to a geocentric tropical natal chart using a quadrant-based house system. 

When using these interpretations, please bear in mind that, inevitably, every chart will contain some contradictory influences, and as a result certain interpretations of different items in the same chart may seem difficult to reconcile. However, this may still be an accurate reflection of what is happening to the individual whose transits are being interpreted, as people do experience conflicting desires, events and circumstances in their lives. It is the responsibility of the astrologer to synthesise these apparent contradictions in order to present a cohesive and realistic interpretation of the dilemmas of the chart.

PROGRESSIONS: Progression Interpretations

Astrologers use the term "Progressions" to describe a particular technique of moving planets forward in time. This technique is aptly named because it describes how a person progresses through their life. Progressions describe the different phases in our lives as well as our inner urges and how they affect our lives rather than dramatic outer events. However, our urges can significantly affect the way in which we react to circumstances and therefore our decisions. It is important that we go with the flow rather than fight against the tides of our lives. Therefore Progressions are likely to show us signposts in life's journey and consequently help us gain wisdom and understanding. Some astrologers believe that Progressions are signs from our soul or higher self; others place less emphasis. We suggest that you read on and see for yourself.

TRANSITING JUPITER TRINE DIRECTED ASCENDANT (9th House to 5th House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Exact 01 1 2020, Leaving 01 5 2020
This is a good time for bountiful relationships. You are confident, warm and fun-loving and this rubs off on all those around you. For this reason you will find that your social life and relationships in general benefit, and opportunities to meet new people and travel may abound.

TRANSITING JUPITER SEMISQUARE PROGRESSED URANUS (9th House to 7th House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Exact 01 1 2020, Leaving 01 5 2020
During this transit you tend to feel irritable and frustrated as you want to break free of past restrictions. Rebellion can be a major problem, particularly if you feel that something or someone is standing in your way. Patience is a virtue which seems so difficult to maintain during this transit, and yet it is the trait which you need to develop.

TRANSITING SATURN OPPOSITION PROGRESSED MERCURY (9th House to 3rd House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Exact 01 1 2020, Leaving 01 9 2020
Tension arises as other people or events challenge your ideas. You may find that others are particularly critical during this transit causing you to rethink your attitudes. Your confidence in making decisions is shaky and therefore it is not a good time to finalise any plans with long-term consequences. Disagreements with others may lead to a breakdown in communications. By the end of this transit you should have a clearer idea of your true opinions and beliefs with a realisation of what can be compromised and what cannot.

TRANSITING NEPTUNE SEXTILE RADIX CHIRON (11th House to 1st House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Leaving 01 1 2020
Opportunities for creative pursuits arise during this period. Peace and solitude may be the theme, as you feel the need to slow down and reflect on your life; however, you could also be busy pursuing avenues for expressing your many talents. It does not matter whether you are busy or enjoying a peaceful pace of life. More importantly you are doing what comes naturally. This is a very healing time.

TRANSITING PLUTO OPPOSITION PROGRESSED MERCURY (9th House to 3rd House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Leaving 01 2 2020
You feel that the world is out to stop you communicating your true self and in fact, it is likely that news from external sources is particularly disturbing during this period. Someone else may be forcing their opinions on you or an unexpected crisis may arise stretching your communication skills to the limit. Written negotiatons and contracts may not run smoothly as someone puts a cog in the wheels. At times you may feel stressed, irritable and overworked. Relax as much as possible and remember that the time will pass and the reasons behind the mix-ups will become clear.

TRANSITING JUPITER SESQUISQUARE RADIX NORTH NODE (9th House to 4th House)
Entering 01 2 2020, Exact 01 7 2020, Leaving 01 11 2020
Relationships with other people are a source of frustration. There is nothing specific that you can identify. It is more a sense that your relationships with individuals and groups of people are not quite all that they should be. Perhaps you feel that you would like to seek the comfort of old affiliations, but for some reason do not seem to be able to rely on former friendships. You may even feel anti-social, more in the mood to reassess your personal and business relationships than to mix. You would do well to wait until you are in a better frame of mind before making any final decisions and to focus ahead rather than look back.

TRANSITING SATURN QUINCUNX PROGRESSED NORTH NODE (9th House to 4th House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Leaving 01 3 2020
Destiny plays a hand in your life forcing you to change your path and reassess your purpose. This could mean literally letting go of people or projects that have helped shaped your life. Alternately it is possible that you are being asked to change your own beliefs about your life purpose. It's possible that you could feel a lack of direction, but this is only a transitory phase as you assimilate necessary changes.

TRANSITING SATURN SEXTILE PROGRESSED URANUS (9th House to 7th House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Exact 01 3 2020, Leaving 01 12 2020
You now have the opportunity to balance a healthy sense of responsibility with the ability to embrace new and exciting concepts. Areas of your life which may have become a little staid are now enlivened. Whereas in the past you may have experienced obstacles to moving in new directions, you now have an understanding that breakthroughs are imminent.

TRANSITING SATURN SESQUISQUARE DIRECTED ASCENDANT (9th House to 5th House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Exact 01 3 2020, Leaving 01 12 2020
During this time you have trouble expressing your true self, particularly in your close relationships. It may also be that you are keen to shoulder extra responsibilities, but there are obstacles in your path. It could be that you are frustrated in your attempts to have more commitment in your relationship with your partner. The lesson is to persist for you will eventually surmount the obstacles and achieve your aims.

TRANSITING JUPITER TRINE PROGRESSED JUPITER (9th House to 5th House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Exact 01 3 2020, Leaving 01 8 2020
Lucky in love and life can be the catchphrase for this transit. Although it is not as powerful as some other Jupiter transits, it is a time of optimism and good fortune. Do not pass up opportunities, but use your discrimination regarding the opportunities that come your way. You may find that the opportunities that arise are connected with travel, study, and anything that expands your horizons.

TRANSITING JUPITER OPPOSITION TRANSITING NORTH NODE (9th House to 3rd House)
Entering 01 4 2020, Exact 01 8 2020, Leaving 01 12 2020
Relations with other people, either individuals or groups, can be stressful during this transit. It is time to reassess your connections with individuals and groups with a view to moving on with your life's purpose. Any individual or group standing in your path is liable to be pushed out of the way, as you seek new experiences. Of course it is not easy to let go of links from the past, particularly if one feels frightened of new experiences without the safety of past alliances. If you can focus on the future rather than the past, you will discover that as one door shuts another opens.

TRANSITING MOON ENTERING TAURUS (1st House)
01 4 2020, 02 1 2020, 02 28 2020, 03 26 2020, 04 22 2020, 05 20 2020, 06 16 2020, 07 13 2020, 08 10 2020, 09 6 2020, 10 3 2020, 10 30 2020, 11 27 2020, 12 24 2020

Entering 01 4 2020, Exact 02 9 2020, Leaving 03 7 2020, Entering 11 1 2020, Leaving 12 26 2020
Opportunities for creative pursuits arise during this period. Peace and solitude may be the theme, as you feel the need to slow down and reflect on your life; however, you could also be busy pursuing avenues for expressing your many talents. It does not matter whether you are busy or enjoying a peaceful pace of life. More importantly you are doing what comes naturally. This is a very healing time.

You are having difficulty pursuing your goals and furthering your plans. It seems that there are many obstacles, which you cannot avoid. Perhaps even your personal relationships are holding you back, or perhaps others are not as appreciative as they could be of your need for fun and enjoyment. Slow down a little and let others adjust to the pace.

Entering 01 6 2020, Exact 01 15 2020, Leaving 01 23 2020

TRANSITING JUPITER QUINCUNX RADIX SUN (9th House to 2nd House)

You are required to make changes and adjustments in your life, particularly in the way that you usually express yourself.

Letting go of old habits can be difficult, but ultimately rewarding as you experience the freedom to embrace new paths.

TRANSITING CHIRON SQUARE DIRECTED URANUS (12th House to 9th House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Leaving 01 6 2020
Juggling all of your commitments is quite a challenge during this transit, and you are in danger of short-circuiting. It is true that you are being asked to incorporate new talents into your life, but you can only do so much. It is painful having to make a choice, but that is exactly what you have to do. Consider your options carefully and move forward knowing that you are following your true path.

TRANSITING SATURN QUINCUNX DIRECTED CHIRON (9th House to 2nd House)
Entering 01 7 2020, Exact 01 15 2020, Leaving 01 24 2020
It is time to let go of emotional patterns which have prevented you from expressing your true self. However, the process may be painful, emotionally or physically. As a result you are particularly sensitive during this time, and need to take good care of yourself. It is possible that an event or person could upset your equilibrium. You may be introspective, pondering on childhood memories and relationships, particularly with parent figures. Although this can be a painful process, there is light at the end of the tunnel. You have the opportunities to gain new understanding of past events and move forward in your life with wisdom and insight.

You have a basic need for mental stimulation. You are curious and seek answers to many questions. You are a chatterbox. When young, you may have called upon your mother to provide stimulation and activity.

TRANSITING JUPITER TRINE RADIX MARS (9th House to 5th House)
Entering 01 8 2020, Exact 01 12 2020, Leaving 01 17 2020
You are confident and optimistic and life seems to be more than meeting your expectations. You are enjoying working towards your goals and having some fun on the way, and you have plenty of energy to achieve your goals. Co-operation is also an easy task, and you find that others are pleased to help you achieve the success that you well deserve. You may also enjoy channelling some of your energy into your favourite sporting activities, where you are also assured of success.

Now is the time to pay attention to the details in your projects, particularly in business and professional dealings. You might like to branch out and start new creative projects, but if you pursue this path it will lead to frustration. You would make a better use of your time and energy if you use this time to consider your plans carefully and attend to your responsibilities. As a result you will then reap the benefits of a job well done.

TRANSITING SATURN CONJUNCTION DIRECTED MOON (9th House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Leaving 01 9 2020
This can be a lonely time when you feel cut off from loved ones and particularly self-critical. Circumstances are such that you cannot seek comfort in your usual way. This therefore throws you back onto your own resources. You may experience rejection from someone close, at a time when you feel a strong need for security. However, it is likely that you have contributed to this rejection, unknowingly creating time for introspection. It is important not to judge yourself or others harshly during this transit and to remember that the outcome is self-growth and a firmer understanding of your strengths and weaknesses.

TRANSITING MOON ENTERING CANCER (3rd House)
01 9 2020, 02 5 2020, 03 4 2020, 03 31 2020, 04 27 2020, 05 25 2020, 06 21 2020, 07 18 2020, 08 15 2020, 09 11 2020, 10 8 2020, 11 4 2020, 12 2 2020, 12 29 2020

Entering 01 10 2020, Exact 01 14 2020, Leaving 01 19 2020
This can be a time when you forget to look before you leap. You feel confident of achieving your goals but may not exercise the appropriate caution. This can also be a time when you feel as though you are living life in the fast lane. It is important to slow down and use some old-fashioned common sense before you take up opportunities that are coming your way right now.

TRANSITING PLUTO SEXTILE PROGRESSED URANUS (9th House to 7th House)
In Orb 01 1 2020, Leaving 01 10 2020, Entering 09 5 2020, Leaving 11 1 2020
This is a highly creative time during which you have lots of energy. You will be eager to try new activities, exploring avenues that you have not explored before. Astrology and metaphysics may appeal as paths to spiritual truth. You will be keen to explore higher realms, and others may come into your life to help you along the way.

TRANSITING JUPITER QUINCUNX DIRECTED VENUS (9th House to 4th House)
Entering 01 10 2020, Exact 01 14 2020, Leaving 01 19 2020
This is the time to say goodbye to loved ones, either literally or emotionally. It could be that a special friend is leaving for greener pastures, or that you feel it is time to part company from a loved one because you have grown apart. Sometimes it is simply that a key relationship in your life needs to adjust in order to meet changing circumstances. Either way this could be a painful time. However, you will eventually see the advantages in making the changes.

Attempts to radically change yourself and the way that you relate to other people are frustrated during this time. Even efforts to change your personal image can be blocked, much to your annoyance.

Watch out for a lack of discretion and restraint during this transit. You are likely to go over the top in your endeavours to achieve your goals. Other people may try to point out your excesses, but you are not in the mood to listen. It would be better if you could slow down and curb any extravagances.

This can be a time of frustration, accompanied by a feeling that you will never achieve your goals. The obstacles seem too high to climb over and too wide to walk around. You are forced to slow down and reassess your life's path. Although this is obviously a difficult period, benefits can come from the process of reassessment. Have some patience and you will discover the advantages of this period through the wisdom of hindsight.

This is a time of extra responsibilities and consolidation of your direction in life. You may be given an extra workload in your chosen profession, or a promotion that demands extra responsibility. If in the past you have chosen your profession in order to please someone else, this can be a time when you decide to take responsibility for your own career choices and begin the process of changing professions. It can also be a time of extra social responsibilities, or a change in social status such as marriage or divorce. Whatever the circumstances this transit gives you the energy to make the changes which help consolidate your life purpose.

You are learning first hand that there is a difference between assertiveness and aggression. The trouble is that you have an overwhelming need to push ahead with all your projects now. Patience seems to desert you. You don't mean to be so forceful but it is simply that you feel such a sense of urgency. Although easier said than done, it would be better if you could slow down and keep things in perspective. Avoid taking risks.

Right now you have plenty of ideas, many opportunities for expanding your horizons and rewards from those in high places. Make the most of this sunny time, but don't overdo it. It is easy to fritter away the current opportunities through grandiosity. Don't do anything too rash. Prioritise. Education is the key to success during this phase. The more that you now learn, the more that you will be able to apply later on.

Now is the time to make the most of any opportunities to lay to rest painful memories, which have haunted you in times gone by, and move into areas that are linked straight to your heart. Opportunities for learning present themselves and you may discover talents that you never knew existed. One person, an important teacher or healer may enter your life, or you could take a study course or travel. Alternatively if this transit happens later in your life, you also may have the chance to express your own teaching and healing talents, finding an appropriate avenue of expression for wisdom gained from past experience.

Right now your communications with other people are laden with a few difficulties. It seems as though your attempts to interact are frustrated and you are not sure why. This is also true for new projects and anything that involves the exchange of information. You are being forced, whether you like it or not, to change the way in which you approach projects and people. It is important that you aim to keep your interactions as calm as possible, avoiding heated arguments. During this phase you are likely to learn when to retreat and when to calmly state your case. Right now you have the chance to improve your network of associates, learn new skills and apply them to your daily life with a little patience and persistence.

This could mean literally leaving your home and family and travelling abroad or metaphorically it is time to reflect on your life's dreams. Your hopes, dreams and wishes can be fulfilled now if you make the most of the opportunities that arise. Travel, study, religion, law and sports could be the vehicles that propel you forward on your life's journey. If you feel jaded and disillusioned then take time to reflect on your heart's desires. Opportunities for change will come around again if you are patient.

This is a testing time when the structures of your life seem less certain. Aspects of your life which seemed once to offer safety and security become less sure during this transit. It may be that you are viewing these areas differently, or it could be that someone else is shaking things up. Either way you are being forced to reassess your plans and purpose, leaving behind any ineffective support systems.

Tensions arise as you struggle achieve your goals. It seems as though other people and external events are deliberately plotting to thwart your every move. However, it may be that you are going overboard in your attempts to get your own way. The trouble is that you want to make great changes in your life, but lack the necessary tolerance and patience to get the timing right. While taking action can certainly have positive effects in the long run, you would also be wise to find the right balance of confidence and patience.

You are feeling frustrated in your relationships with loved ones, particularly with women. It could seem that there are barriers that stop you being close to your loved ones or you could feel isolated and unable to scale the walls that surround you emotionally. It could also be that you are frustrated with your domestic scene. Perhaps you are trying to renovate your home or move house, but there are delays. Try not to force situations. The best way of dealing with these problems is to let the emotions settle rather than stirring them up.

It's time to search deep within and reassess your personal goals asking questions such as: Do I still hold this ambition close to my heart? and Am I doing all that I can to achieve my goal? It may be time to make changes in your life to better help you achieve your personal desires. It is important that you focus on spiritual ambition rather than material desires.

You have the ability to create a fortunate balance between fun and work. You shoulder your responsibilities while at the same time making the most of new opportunities to expand your world. You feel confident in many areas of your life, as you use your good judgement to make decisions that have the potential for long-term success. It is a time when you can tap into your own wisdom. Business dealings may prosper. The only drawback could be that you take this time for granted and let opportunities slip through your fingers. In other words "wise and considered action" is what is needed.

It is time to reassess your affiliations with individuals and groups with a view to moving on with your life's purpose. You may also need to adjust your expectations, letting go of outdated goals or ambitions. It is time to seek new experiences, particularly those which can add to your knowledge. Of course letting go of old friends and alliances is not easy. Neither is it a simple task to adjust one's expectations, but remember that as one door shuts another opens.

Opportunities abound for you to explore new ways of communicating your thoughts and ideas if you choose to take notice. It is also a good time to forgive and forget old wounds from the past, and to open up the communication lines with others. You are feeling intuitive and sensitive to the needs of others. Therefore you may be provided with the opportunity to lend a sensitive ear to other people's troubles.  You are also open to new insights and understandings, and despite feeling vulnerable, have the opportunity to see all areas of your life in a new light.

You lack tact and diplomacy during this transit. You are also in danger of being opinionated and blunt. Others may be quick to point out these faults, which you find irritating rather than helpful. However, it would be useful to think before you speak. A little restraint could go a long way.

During this time you are cut off from other people. Negatively this can be because you are feeling lonely and failing to reach out to others, or positively because you are using the time for some serious contemplation. Beware of your own gloom at this time. You may feel that many areas of your life have failed leaving you with an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. There is a reason for these negative thoughts and feelings. This transit is demanding that you see your life in a different light, a more spiritual rather than physical light. At first this can be depressing as you realise the hopelessness of pursuing purely personal ambitions which have no greater purpose. However, by the end of the transit you will have incorporated a larger and more selfless view and may have a clearer vision for the future. Contemplation and meditation can prove very useful during this time.

You are having difficulty pursuing your goals and furthering your plans. It seems that there are many obstacles, which you cannot avoid. Perhaps even your personal relationships are holding you back, or perhaps others are not as appreciative as they could be of your need for fun and enjoyment. Slow down a little and let others adjust to the pace.

Now is the time to face your fears and move towards your true purpose. You need to let go of emotional hurts which stand in your way and take action. Feel the fear and do it anyway.

You have the ability to create a fortunate balance between fun and work. You shoulder your responsibilities while at the same time making the most of new opportunities to expand your world. You feel confident in many areas of your life, as you use your good judgement to make decisions that have the potential for long-term success. It is a time when you can tap into your own wisdom. Business dealings may prosper. The only drawback could be that you take this time for granted and let opportunities slip through your fingers. In other words "wise and considered action" is what is needed.

TRANSITING URANUS SEXTILE TRANSITING NORTH NODE (1st House to 3rd House)
Entering 03 11 2020, Exact 03 18 2020, Leaving 03 24 2020
New experiences abound prompting a change of direction more in line with your true purpose in life. This could involve meeting new groups of people, an exciting new relationship, change of career or new interest. It could also involve metaphysics, science, environmental interests or technology. This is a metaphysical time during which you have the opportunity to become more alive and open to life's excitement. It's also possible that you will take up activities that, although not obviously linked with your ultimate purpose, will stand you in good stead later in life. Our own ideas of our true purpose at one stage in life may differ at a later stage. So keep an open mind and make the most of any opportunities that pass your way.

This can be a time of frustration, accompanied by a feeling that you will never achieve your goals. The obstacles seem too high to climb over and too wide to walk around. You are forced to slow down and reassess your life's path. Although this is obviously a difficult period, benefits can come from the process of reassessment. Have some patience and you will discover the advantages of this period through the wisdom of hindsight.

PROGRESSED MOON SQUARE PROGRESSED JUPITER (2nd House to 5th House)
Entering 03 12 2020, Exact 04 7 2020, Leaving 05 4 2020
Everything seems a little larger than life right now. You feel as if all of your dreams and wishes are coming true now. In some ways you are correct. Life is full of many rewards right now. However, you need to make choices rather than try to take on every opportunity that comes your way. If you are not careful you may well overindulge and overestimate your own abilities. As a result your life may become imbalanced. You need to make sure that you do not neglect one area of your life as you pursue your own goals. You need to balance your home, family, work and marriage, with your own interests and appetites. The problem is that you are currently going through a somewhat egotistical stage. On the positive side you are eager to achieve your goals and are quite capable of doing so. Gifts, rewards and awards may well come your way. You may also attract warm wishes and gifts from friends, lovers, colleagues and family members. However, if you are not careful you squander your opportunities by taking things or people for granted. As a result you over-commit yourself, neglect loved ones and run out of energy. A time of short-term excess can result in loss of all that is meaningful. If you can slow down and appreciate the gifts and those who give then you are most likely to gain some enduring benefits. However, if you remain self-righteous and continue to indulge your every whim then you could fritter away this period of your life.

Heated discussions, angry thoughts and accusations may erupt during this transit. Your ideas and opinions are being challenged.

You may feel the urge to seek out new information. By the end of the transit you will feel liberated from old thought patterns which hampered your outlook on life and will have greater clarity in your life.

During this time you could fall prey to deception, either your own self-delusion or someone else's veiled actions. This time can be tense as you are unsure about exactly what is going on. It is as if you are in a boat at sea and a fog has descended leaving you unsure of which way to head to shore. While this time can be beneficial because of the type of tension sometimes needed in a creative project, it is normally not a good time to be entering major business deals or making life-changing decisions. You would do better to rest, relax and avoid meeting difficult situations head-on.

However, you may feel a little shaky. Don't be too hard on yourself. Rather, take some time out to reflect on what is really important in life.

There are a few transits in astrology which are linked with what society calls the "mid-life crisis". This is one of them and usually occurs in your early 40s. During this transit you review your life's goals and dreams. Like the character Scrooge in Charles Dickens' tale of The Christmas Carol you have the chance to reflect on your visions of the past, present and for the future. You see what has been achieved and what remainsto be done. In some cases you can feel disillusioned at how little you have achieved. The trouble is that you are vulnerable to feelings of failure right now. However, on a more positive note, by the end of this transit you can also gain much insight into which visions may have been sheer wishful thinking and which are achievable.

It is time for you to shine in your life. Theoretically this should be easy. However, it is possible that you have to learn a few lessons before moving forward with your true goals. If you have been living a balanced life then this is a rewarding phase of your life during which you achieve a new sense of purpose. However, if one area of your life has been dominating then you may be called on to redress the imbalance. For instance if you have been pouring most of your time and energy into your career at the expense of your home life then an event of person may trigger a need for changes. If you avoid the changes then you could experience difficulties or even a crisis. If you make the necessary adjustments now then you are likely to feel renewed vigour. Others appreciate your ability to compromise and help support your aspirations. New doors open now and you appreciate the stimulation of new relationships and opportunities. This is an ideal time for taking stock of all aspects of your life and making the necessary adjustments.

You are feeling energetic right now, ready to tackle big jobs and new activities. You may also feel a readiness to face any fears that have previously blocked your ambitions. Therefore this period is conducive to undertaking any tasks or projects that require concentrated efforts and initiative. You may initiative a new field of activity or you may be forced by someone else or circumstances to take on a project that you previously would have shied away from. Either way you have the drive to succeed. One of the risks of this phase is that you are tempted to go overboard in your efforts to achieve your objectives because you are keen to move forward regardless of the costs. Impatience may mar this period. Therefore you need to ensure that you pay closer attention to your aims. Patience and collaboration are needed, rather than competition. Save any competitive urges for a demanding sport or solo adventure rather than projects that require the co-operation of other people. Avoid rash decisions and stressors that trigger your temper and this can be a rewarding phase during which your motivation is strong and your achievements satisfying.

It's time to face the truth. No matter how painful this might be, you cannot hide. It is common for areas of our lives to become stale. Inside we have changed and grown, but our external circumstances have not yet caught up. Now is the time of recognition.

There are a few transits in astrology which are linked with what society calls the "mid-life crisis". This is one of them and usually occurs in your early 40s. During this transit you review your life's goals and dreams. Like the character Scrooge in Charles Dickens' tale of The Christmas Carol you have the chance to reflect on your visions of the past, present and for the future. You see what has been achieved and what remainsto be done. In some cases you can feel disillusioned at how little you have achieved. The trouble is that you are vulnerable to feelings of failure right now. However, on a more positive note, by the end of this transit you can also gain much insight into which visions may have been sheer wishful thinking and which are achievable.

You are being forced to change your direction in life and to realign your goals on a more spiritual basis. This could be through a physical illness which forces you to slow down and contemplate your future or an event which has sparked deep emotions. Perhaps you are feeling a lack of emotional satisfaction in your current pursuits and this is causing you to search for more meaningful pursuits or perhaps something has happened which threatens your goals and ambitions. This could be connected with a male friend or member of your family. It is also possible that you are on a new path which is challenging your deep-seated fears of failure or success. It is important that you work through any emotions so that you can clearly assess your future in the light of your true purpose. Now is the time to let go of old ambitions in order to make way for new and more meaningful pursuits.

The effect of this transit is to disrupt your most intimate relationship forcing problems out into the open. Whereas once you were content to compromise your freedom for the comfort of a predictable relationship, now you will feel restless and caged in by the constraints. You may be surprised by a lack commitment in your personal relationships. You may be wilful and see anyone else's claim on you as an obstacle to your freedom of self-expression.  You need to beware of jeopardising the benefits of your relationship. The key is to keep the good parts, while examining and find new solutions for the areas in which you are limited. You may also experience financial tensions during this time.

It could seem that there are barriers that stop you being close to your loved ones or you could feel isolated and unable to scale the walls that surround you emotionally. It could also be that you are frustrated with your domestic scene. Perhaps you are trying to renovate your home or move house, but there are delays. Old emotional reactions are no longer helpful. You need to find new ways to respond to emotional situations and to comfort yourself. In the meantime keep going because the delays will clear and you will feel much better having achieved some emotional equilibrium.

It is time to concentrate on practical matters. This could affect any area of your life ranging from an important career project to building a new home. You need to decide your priorities and focus on the tasks at hand. The more that you try to ignore your responsibilities, the more frustrated you will feel during this phase. On the other hand you have the ability to achieve your objectives through patience and hard work.

Hurt and healing are themes of this phase. It is possible that one or more of your relationships with loved ones is emotionally demanding right now. You are urged to face the truth and act with integrity. Try also to nurture yourself and your loves ones. If you can do these things then healing is possible.

A spiritual retreat or health farm may also renew your energy. On the other hand you may need to take care of someone close to you right now. Broken promises to yourself and others need to be rectified.

This is an intensely emotional time, possibly one of the most emotional times of your life. Changes, usually involving your family and in particular mother or other women in the family, invoke powerful emotions. You may suffer grief, or enter into an intense emotional battle with a loved one or authorities. Metaphysical and self-improvement courses will be deeply healing, as will psychotherapy. It is best to use this time to delve deeply into your emotions and let go of old emotional habits and embrace your loved ones with a sense of honesty and integrity that comes from the depths of your being.

This is an emotional time, during which your feelings are not as reliable as usual. The trouble is that you are likely to overreact right now. Close personal friends and relatives, in particular women, are stirring up your feelings. Perhaps you are hurt by their actions, or perhaps they are reacting to you. Your life is changing and you feel insecure. These changes are likely to be occurring in your family and home life. You may even move house during this period. On the other hand the changes may be taking place within. However, these changes are manifesting in your life, your perceptions are unlikely to be correct right now. You would be well advised to think before you speak. It is far better to take some time to carefully consider your words and actions until you are feeling more secure. In the meantime you could enjoy reading moving stories, going to the cinema or spending time with young children and animals. Counseling may also be beneficial, if you feel that it would help you adapt to your changing relationships and environment.

Before you can move forward in your life, you have to have to put the finishing touches to responsibilities of the past. This can include completing the final details of a project, helping a loved one adjust to new circumstances, seeing out a term of office for a group or termination of an agreement in your profession. Whatever the circumstances you need courage to finish one cycle before starting another.

It is time to reassess your affiliations with individuals and groups with a view to moving on with your life's purpose. You may also need to adjust your expectations, letting go of outdated goals or ambitions. It is time to seek new experiences, particularly those which can add to your knowledge. Of course letting go of old friends and alliances is not easy. Neither is it a simple task to adjust one's expectations, but remember that as one door shuts another opens.

Romance and good fortunes are highlighted during this period. If you are married you may rekindle feelings of love and togetherness. It's time to create tender moments. If you are single, you may fall in love with someone, either an old flame or someone new. Your powers of attraction are strong right now, so be sure to use your influence well. You and your loved one are quite starry-eyed, so relax and enjoy sharing intimate and loving occasions. Affection and pleasure are the name of the game. It is possible that you remain single during this period; perhaps your feelings for someone are strong but unrequited. It is also possible that a loved one will end a relationship during this period of your life. If this is the case then you need to nurture yourself and share pleasurable times with your friends and family, knowing that someone better is waiting in the wings. You may also benefit from following a passionate past time, particularly one involving the arts, fashion or beauty. It is not time for recriminations, but rather time to indulge your passions. Your finances should be well able to support your pleasurable activities during this phase, within reason.

During this transit you may have difficulty striking a balance between your own personal goals and your responsibilities. Tension can arise as you feel the need to break out of old restrictions. Although your tolerance level may be low, you would do well to cultivate the assistance of others, rather than meeting them head on or simply giving up on them. The benefits of this transit is that you are forced to take action in restructuring areas of your life which may have become stagnant and tired.

You may also enjoy channelling some of your energy into your favourite sporting activities, where you are also assured of success.

This can be a beneficial transit during which you feel an increased joy in your responsibilities. You now feel that you have the ability to achieve a sensible balance in your life reaping benefits from past hard work and planting seeds for the future. This may take many forms including career promotion, others recognising your work and opportunities to study or travel. In some cases you may feel the urge to make changes to your current lifestyle to accommodate your need for expansion. The only hitch to this transit can be that you may lack tolerance for anyone who stands in your way as you seek to expand your horizons. If this is the case enlist the help of others rather than tempting them to work against you.

This is a time of heightened intuition during which you feel tempted to explore a more spiritual or artistic side of life. Even if religions have never before seemed inviting, you may now start to ponder the meaning of life and explore different religious avenues. You may be tempted to go on some sort of spiritual quest. However, one of the problems with this transit can be that you are seeing everything through rose-tinted glasses. In other words you may be vulnerable to the charlatans of the world as you are extraordinarily sensitive during this transit. You may also feel the urge to take on some charity work. While this can be a beneficial act, you need to beware of wasting your energy on people who do not want to be helped, but would prefer to remain victims of society. Also beware of being lured into the world of addiction through drugs of any kind. You would do better to explore spiritual pursuits, metaphysical subjects, or latent artistic talents without entering schemes that could have long-term ramifications.

This is the time to say goodbye to loved ones, either literally or emotionally. It could be that a special friend is leaving for greener pastures, or that you feel it is time to part company from a loved one because you have grown apart. Sometimes it is simply that a key relationship in your life needs to adjust in order to meet changing circumstances. Either way this could be a painful time. However, you will eventually see the advantages in making the changes.

TRANSITING NEPTUNE SQUARE PROGRESSED MOON (11th House to 2nd House)
Entering 12 27 2020
You are currently undergoing a time of emotional tension, particularly in your domestic life. Relationships with loved ones at home, with mother or with women friends, are dominated by emotional upsets. You are unsure sometimes what is causing the upsets. It is almost as if a fog has temporarily descended and it is true that you may not be seeing things clearly. It is best to seek the advice of an objective friend, someone who will help prevent you from taking everything personally. Although your intuition is heightened, you are easily upset and may be feeling emotional insecure. This time can be associated with grief and loss. The best way to handle this transit is to avoid taking on extra responsibilities, to rest and nurture yourself. You will have greater insight at the end.

TRANSITING JUPITER SEMISQUARE TRANSITING NEPTUNE (10th House to 11th House)

You may find yourself daydreaming of better times. Daydreaming is okay: this is not the best time for making life-changing decisions or entering into agreements which demand clear judgement. Later on, when the clouds have lifted, you will be grateful for the delays.
